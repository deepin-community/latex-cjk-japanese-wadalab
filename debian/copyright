  You can use/modify/distribute this font as long as:
  .
    1) add a note which explains that the distributed fonts
       are derived from wadalab fonts which is distributed
       at ftp.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp
  .
    2) if the redistribution is the modified one from the original
       font archives, then provide some documentations which explain
       the changes/modifications from the original font archives.
  .
  These conditions are to inform users about where they
  can get the most updated font from, because we plan
  to update it.
  .
  If you find the badly designed glyphs, or wrong kanji
  characters, please contact at tanaka@ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp
