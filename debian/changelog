  * The "Why Twitter if you've got the Debian changelog?" release.
  * Acknowledge the NMU.  Thanks, Norbert.
  * [control]
     - Add Vcs-* and Homepage tags;
     - bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3;
     - depend on debhelper (>= 7);
     - add a build-dependency on tex-common (>= 1.20) to get support
       for trigger-happy fingers;
     - change the maintainer's email address.
  * [compat] Bump to Debhelper v7.
  * [rules] Debhelper v7 makes some cleaning procedures unnecessary.
  * [watch] Remove it; the font will not get an upstream update anymore, and
     the "mangle" option in the watch file was incorrectly configured anyway.
  * [copyright] Add "Copyright" line and "1994" to satisfy Lintian.  The
     year is derived from the timestamp of the copyright file on the DANTE
     FTP site.
  * [latex-cjk/*] Update to upstream release of 4.8.2.
  * [install] Remove bashisms.
  * [README.Debian-source, README.source] Renamed the file from the former name
     into the latter to comply with Standards-Version 3.8.0.
  * [changelog] Change the maintainer's email address.

latex-cjk-japanese-wadalab (0.20050817-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Carabosse is finally defeated" release.
  * [control]
     - Remove the dependency on latex-cjk-japanese (>= 4.6.0) and teTeX;
     - don't build-depend on texlive-base-bin and tex-common (>= 0.19) anymore,
       since texlive-font-utils already depends on them;
     - bumped up the Standards-Version from 3.7.2.0 to 3.7.3;
     - depend on debhelper (>= 6).
  * [compat] Change from debhelper V5 to V6.
  * [latex-cjk/c70*.fdx] CJK git20080115 provides improved vertical support
     for Unicode Wadalab.
  * [preinst] dh_installtex has moved the default priority from 10 to 20,
     rendering the /etc/texmf/updmap.d/10latex-cjk-japanese-wadalab.cfg
     conffile obsolete.  This script will create a backup in
     /etc/texmf/updmap.d/ if you have manually modified the 10*.cfg file.
     Thanks to Kumar Appaiah (Closes: #455460).
  * [makefont] Upstream version now includes a copyright notice.
  * [rules]
     - Fix bashism: apparently other shells don't understand the accolade.
       Thanks to Michele Angrisano (Closes: #457575, #457578);
     - hopefully the FTBFS on Schepler's parallel CPU computer is fixed, now
       that I've removed some cruft in debian/rules.  dpkg-buildpackage in
       cowbuilder works (Closes: #458990).

latex-cjk-japanese-wadalab (0.20050817-13) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency is set to high because of an FTBFS bug fix.
  * [control]
     - Build-Depend on "texlive-font-utils", which provides
       "vptovf".  This fixes "FTBFS: Can't exec "vptovf": No such file
       or directory at makeuniwada.pl line 120" (Closes: #422399).
       Thanks to Lucas Nussbaum;
     - change "tetex-bin" to "tetex-extra";
     - prefer TeXlive over teTeX in the Build-Dependencies and Dependencies;
     - minor cleanup, and add dependencies on "${misc:Depends}".
       Thanks to Florent Rougon.
  * [rules] add a few arguments after "dh_testdir" when cleaning, to make
     sure we're deleting the correct directory.  Thanks to Florent Rougon
  * [watch] clean it up, and locally force the version numbers of most
     packages.

     change the maintainer's email address.

  * [watch] change version numbers into "(.*)".
  * [rules] according to Debian Policy section 4.6, it is advised
     to use a double ampersand instead of a semicolon because of
     "sh"'s poor error trapping.
  * [control]
     Add the names of the three font flavours "Mincho", "Gothic" and "Maru".

  * [rules] added error trapping.  Thanks to Frank Küster and
     Norbert Preining.
  * [control] added Build-Depend on tetex-bin (>= 3.0) | texlive-font-utils.
     It works in pbuilder now.  Thanks to Norbert Preining.
  * [patches/01_fix_wftodm.dpatch]
     - change <sys/time.h> into <time.h>; otherwise it will segfault on AMD64.
       Thanks to Masami Ichikawa <masami256@gmail.com>.
     - add a fix to be able to use only one directory as argument instead
       of two; this will solve the 0300 exit code when building the mc2
       and mr2 fonts with wftodm.

  * I forgot to put the virtual fonts in /usr/share/fonts/vf/wadalab.
  * Put the Unicode encoded TFM files in
    /usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/wadalab/Unicode/, and the rest of the (virtual)
    TFM fonts in usr/share/texmf/fonts/tfm/wadalab/JIS/.
  * Put the c70*.fd files in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/CJK/UTF8/ instead
    of JIS/.
  * Depend on tex-common (>=0.14), because dh_installtexfont has fixed
    a bug with the dvips config.* files.
  * Also support installation in TeXlive distribution, by depending on
    texlive-base-bin and texlive-latex-base in that case.

  * Build-depend on debhelper (>=5.0.0) and depend on tetex-bin (>= 3.0)
